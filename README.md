ActiveRecord::Turntable is a database sharding extension for ActiveRecord.

## Dependencies

activerecord(>=4.0.0)

if you are using activerecord 3.x, please use activerecord-turntable version 1.x.

## Supported Database

Currently supports mysql only.

## Installation

Add to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-turntable', '~> 2.1.1'
```

Run a bundle install:

```ruby
bundle install
```

Run install generator:

```bash
bundle exec rails g active_record:turntable:install
```

generator creates `#{Rails.root}/config/turntable.yml`

## Terminologies

### Shard

Shard is a database which is horizontal partitioned.

### Cluster

Cluster of shards. i.e) set of userdb1, userdb2, userdb3
Shards in the same cluster should have the same schema structure.

### Master

Default ActiveRecord::Base's connection.

### Sequencer

Turntable's sequence system for clustered database.

This keeps primary key ids to be unique each shards.

## Example

### Example Databases Structure

One main database(default ActiveRecord::Base connection) and
three user databases sharded by user_id.

```
                  +-------+
                  |  App  |
                  +-------+
                      |
       +---------+---------+---------+---------+
       |         |         |         |         |
  `--------` `-------` `-------` `-------` `-------`
  | Master | |UserDB1| |UserDB2| |UserDB3| | SeqDB |
  `--------` `-------` `-------` `-------` `-------`

```

### Example Configuration

Edit turntable.yml and database.yml. See below example config.

* example turntable.yml

```yaml
    development:
      clusters:
        user_cluster: # <-- cluster name
          algorithm: range_bsearch # <-- `range`, `range_bsearch` or `modulo`
          seq:
            user_seq: # <-- sequencer name
              seq_type: mysql # <-- sequencer type
              connection: user_seq_1 # <-- sequencer database connection setting
          shards:
            - connection: user_shard_1 # <-- shard name
              less_than: 100           # <-- shard range(like mysql partitioning) If you are using a modulo algorithm, it doesn't need it.
            - connection: user_shard_2
              less_than: 200
            - connection: user_shard_3
              less_than: 2000000000

```

* database.yml

```yaml
    connection_spec: &spec
      adapter: mysql2
      encoding: utf8
      reconnect: false
      pool: 5
      username: root
      password: root
      socket: /tmp/mysql.sock

    development:
      <<: *spec
      database: sample_app_development
      seq: # <-- sequence database definition
        user_seq_1:
          <<: *spec
          database: sample_app_user_seq_development
      shards: # <-- shards definition
        user_shard_1:
          <<: *spec
          database: sample_app_user1_development
        user_shard_2:
          <<: *spec
          database: sample_app_user2_development
        user_shard_3:
          <<: *spec
          database: sample_app_user3_development
```

### Example Migration 

Generate a model:

```bash
bundle exec rails g model user name:string
```

And Edit migration file:

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  # Specify cluster executes migration if you need.
  # Default, migration would be executed to all databases.
  # clusters :user_cluster

  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end
    create_sequence_for(:users) # <-- create sequence table
  end
end
```

Then please execute rake tasks:

```bash
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

Those rake tasks would be executed to shards too.

### Example Model

Add turntable [shard_key_name] to the model class:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  turntable :user_cluster, :id
  sequencer :user_seq
  has_one :status
end

class Status < ActiveRecord::Base
  turntable :user_cluster, :user_id
  sequencer :user_seq
  belongs_to :user
end
```

       (0.2ms) [Shard: user_shard_3] SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `users`
    => 1
```

## Sequencer

Sequencer provides generating global IDs.

Turntable has follow 2 sequencers currently:

* :mysql - Use database table to generate ids.
* :barrage - Use [barrage](https://github.com/drecom/barrage) gem to generate ids

### Mysql example

First, add configuration to turntable.yml and database.yml

* database.yml

```yaml
    development:
      ...
      seq: # <-- sequence database definition
        user_seq_1:
          <<: *spec
          database: sample_app_user_seq_development
```

* turntable.yml

```yaml
    development:
      clusters:
        user_cluster: # <-- cluster name
          ....
          seq:
            user_seq: # <-- sequencer name
              seq_type: mysql # <-- sequencer type
              connection: user_seq_1 # <-- sequencer database connection 
```

Add below to the migration:

```ruby
create_sequence_for(:users) # <-- this line creates sequence table named `users_id_seq`
```

Next, add sequencer definition to the model:

```ruby
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    turntable :id
    sequencer :user_seq # <-- this line enables sequencer module
    has_one :status
  end
```

### Barrage example

First, add barrage gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'barrage'
```

Then, add configuration to turntable.yml:

* turntable.yml

```yaml
    development:
      clusters:
        user_cluster: # <-- cluster name
          ....
          seq:
            barrage_seq: # <-- sequencer name
              seq_type: barrage # <-- sequencer type
              options: # <-- options passed to barrage
                generators:
                  - name: msec
                    length: 39 # MAX 17.4 years from start_at
                    start_at: 1396278000000 # 2014/04/01 00:00:00 JST
                  - name: redis_worker_id
                    length: 16
                    ttl: 300
                    redis:
                      host: '127.0.0.1'
                  - name: sequence
                    length: 9
```

Next, add sequencer definition to the model:

```ruby
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    turntable :id
    sequencer :barrage_seq # <-- this line enables sequencer module
    has_one :status
  end
```

## Transactions
Turntable has some transaction support methods.

### shards_transaction

Pass AR::Base instances, `shards_transaction` method suitable shards

```ruby
user = User.find(2)
user3 = User.create(name: "hoge3")

User.shards_transaction([user, user3]) do
  user.name  = "hogehoge"
  user3.name = "hogehoge3"
  user.save!
  user3.save!
end
```

### cluster_transaction

transaction helper to execute transaction to all shards in the cluster:

```ruby
User.user_cluster_transaction do 
  # Transaction is opened all shards in "user_cluster" 
end
```

### Migration

If you specify cluster or shard, migration will be executed to the cluster(or shard) and master database.

Default, migrations will be executed to all databases.

to specify cluster:

```ruby
    class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
      clusters :user_cluster
      ....
    end
```

to specify shard:

```ruby
    class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
      shards :user_shard_01
      ....
    end
```

## Limitations

* Queries includes "ORDER BY", "GROUP BY" and "LIMIT" clauses cannot be distributed.
* "has many through" and "habtm" relationships may causes wrong results. ex) `User-Friend-User` relation


## TIPS

### Send query to a specific shard.

Use `with_shard` method:

```ruby
    AR::Base.connection.with_shard(shard1) do
      # something queries to shard1
    end
```

To access shard objects, use below:

* AR::Base.connection.shards # \\{shard_name => shard_obj,....}
* AR::Base#turntable_shard # Returns current object's shard
* AR::Base.connection.select_shard(shard_key_value) #=> shard

### Send query to all shards

Use with_all method:

```ruby
  User.connection.with_all do
    User.order("created_at DESC").limit(3).all
  end
```

### Connection Management

Rails's ConnectionManagement middleware keeps ActiveRecord's connection during the process is alive, but Turntable keeps more connections.
This may cause flooding max connections on your database. So, we made a middleware that disconnects on each request.

if you use turntable's ConnectionManagement middleware, add below line to your initializer.

```ruby
app.middleware.swap ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionManagement, ActiveRecord::Turntable::Rack::ConnectionManagement
```

### Performance Exception

To notice queries causing performance problem, Turntable has follow options.

* raise\_on\_not\_specified\_shard\_query - raises on queries execute on all shards
* raise\_on\_not\_specified\_shard\_update - raises on updates executed on all shards 


Add to turntable.yml:

```yaml
development:
   ....
   raise_on_not_specified_shard_query: true
   raise_on_not_specified_shard_update: true
```
